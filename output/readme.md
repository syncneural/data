# Energy Data Processing Outputs

This document explains the outputs generated by the energy data processing script (proc.py). The outputs consist of three main CSV files, each serving a different purpose with a distinct set of data. Below is a detailed description of each file, what data it contains, and how it differs from the others.

## 1. `processed_energy_data.csv`

**Description**: This file contains the most recent processed energy data for each country, filtered based on the latest available complete data - normally energy data only becomes complete after two years - but this is recent enough to be meaningful.

**Key Features**:

- Contains data for the latest available year where all countries in the world are recorded.
- Columns include key metrics such as `country`, `iso_code`, `year`, `population`, `gdp`, `electricity_generation`, and other energy-specific metrics. See the codebook.csv for the full list.
- Unit conversions have been applied to the source data to match the needs of the Sync Neural ecosystem (e.g., TWh to kWh).
- Countries with no `population` or `electricity_demand` (such as Antarctica) are removed to ensure complete data for analysis.
- Numeric columns are rounded for better readability (e.g., GDP values are rounded to zero decimal places, percentages to 2 decimal places).

**Use Case**: This dataset is intended for analyses that require  the most recent comparable data for all countries, enabling insights into the  state of energy production and consumption worldwide.

## 2. `processed_energy_data_20xx_20yy.csv`

**Description**: This file contains energy data from the last 12 years for each country, encompassing a broader time range than the `processed_energy_data.csv` file. It is intended to provide longitudinal data for trend analysis over time.

**Key Features**:

- Covers multiple years, currently for the last 12 years, for each country. To change this time range, the config.yaml can be adjusted.
- Includes columns that track important energy production and consumption metrics over time, such as `biofuel_electricity`, `solar_electricity`, `fossil_electricity`, and more, but excludes percentage share, etc.
- Unit conversions (e.g., TWh to kWh) and column renaming are also applied to ensure consistency with other datasets.
- Again, rows with either `population` or `electricity_demand` of zero are excluded.

**Use Case**: This dataset is suited for trend analysis and comparative studies, allowing analysts to understand changes and patterns in energy production and consumption across different countries over the last decade.

## 3. `codebook.csv`

**Description**: The `codebook.csv` file provides metadata for the columns in the processed datasets. It contains descriptions of the columns, units of measurement, and other useful metadata for understanding the datasets.

**Key Features**:

- Lists all columns present in the processed datasets, along with descriptions, units, and sources.
- Reflects any changes made during data processing from the original dataset, such as unit conversions from TWh to kWh.

**Use Case**: The codebook is intended for users of the `processed_energy_data.csv` and `processed_energy_data_20xx_20yy.csv` files to better understand the context and units of the various metrics available in the datasets.
